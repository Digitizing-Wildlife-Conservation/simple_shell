The "C - Simple Shell" project is a significant achievement within the ALX Africa Software Engineering C code curriculum. It involves the development of a Unix-based shell, aiming to deepen students' understanding of advanced shell programming concepts, such as processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and robust error handling. This shell, coded exclusively in C, faithfully replicates the functionality of the standard Unix shell (sh). It features a user-friendly interface with a prompt for command input, robust error handling, and support for various features, including logical operators, variable replacements, command history, and more. The project also includes built-in commands like exit, env, setenv, alias, unsetenv, cd, and help. Installation is straightforward through cloning the repository and compiling the files using the GCC compiler. Overall, it's a comprehensive project designed to enhance students' shell programming skills.
